# Real-time Credit Scoring with Feast on Local Setup

## Overview
This tutorial is built from the original **[feast-aws-credit-scoring-tutorial](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-aws-credit-scoring-tutorial)**.  

This tutorial demonstrates the use of Feast as part of a real-time credit scoring application.
* The primary training dataset is a loan table. This table contains historic loan data with accompanying features. The dataset also contains a target variable, namely whether a user has defaulted on their loan.
* Feast is used during training to enrich the loan table with zipcode and credit history features from the **data** folder.
* Feast is also used to serve the latest zipcode and credit history features for online credit scoring using Redis

To get a better feel of what this example entails, you can view the steps outlined below in notebook 
form in [demo_walkthrough.ipynb](demo_walkthrough.ipynb).

## Requirements

* Python 3.11
* Registry: Postgresql  
* Offline Storage: duckdb  
* Online Storage: Redis

## Setup

### Database Setup
 
You can setup the storages with Podman or Docker:  

1. Setup Postgresql and Redis by [Podman](https://podman.io/):  
```
podman pull docker://bitnami/postgresql  
podman run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgresql -e "ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes" docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:latest  

podman pull docker://bitnami/redis:latest
podman run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis docker.io/bitnami/redis:latest  
```


2. Setup Postgresql and Redis by Docker:  
```
docker pull bitnami/postgresql:latest
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgresql -e "ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes" bitnami/postgresql:latest

docker pull bitnami/redis:latest
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis -e "ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes" bitnami/redis:latest
```

Please **create** a database named "feast" for Feast's SQL Registry service. It is required by the Registry setting in the **feature_store.yaml**. Feel free to use other names, but to make sure that they are the same and consistent.

This can be done via:
```bash
% psql postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432
psql (13.4, server 16.3)
WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 16.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# create database feast
postgres-# ;
CREATE DATABASE
```

### Pointing to remote databases

Rather than provisioning the storage providers locally, you can also provision
them remotely and point to them in [feature_store.yaml](feature_repo/feature_store.yaml)
by specifying the following environment variables:

  * POSTGRES_HOST
  * POSTGRES_USER
  * POSTGRES_PASSWORD
  * POSTGRES_DB
  * REDIS_HOST

### Setting up Feast

Install Feast using pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We have already set up a feature repository in [feature_repo/](feature_repo/). As a result, all we have to do is configure the [feature_store.yaml/](feature_repo/feature_store.yaml) in the feature repository. Please set the connection string of the Postgresql and Redis according to your local infra setup.  

Deploy the feature store by running `apply` from within the `feature_repo/` folder
```
cd feature_repo/
feast apply
```
```
Deploying infrastructure for credit_history
Deploying infrastructure for zipcode_features
```

Next we load features into the online store using the `materialize-incremental` command. This command will load the
latest feature values from a data source into the online store.

```
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME
```

Alternatively, you may have to run
```
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize 1990-01-00T00:00:00  $CURRENT_TIME
```

Return to the root of the repository
```
cd ..
```

## Train and test the model

Finally, we train the model using a combination of loan data from the parque file under the `./data` folder and our zipcode and credit history features from duckdb (with Filesource). And then we test online inference by reading those same features from Redis.

```
python run.py
```
The script should then output the result of a single loan application
```
loan rejected!
```

## Interactive demo (using Streamlit)

Once the credit scoring model has been trained it can be used for interactive loan applications using Streamlit:

Simply start the Streamlit application
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Then navigate to the URL on which Streamlit is being served. You should see a user interface through which loan applications can be made:

## Serving Demo and OpenAPI docs

You can run
```bash
python app.py
```
And you'll be able to see the endpoints by going to http://127.0.0.1:8888/docs#/.
