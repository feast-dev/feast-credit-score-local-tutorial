## üìà Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Retrieval
```python

fs = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

# Get historical features for training
entity_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "dob_ssn": ["19790429_9552", "19971025_8002"],
    "event_timestamp": [datetime.now(), datetime.now()]
})

training_df = fs.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features=[
        "credit_history:credit_card_due",
        "credit_history:missed_payments_6m",
        "person_demographics:person_income",
        "total_debt_calc:total_debt_due"
    ]
).to_df()
```

### Feature Service Usage
```python
# Use pre-defined feature service
features = fs.get_online_features(
    features=fs.get_feature_service("credit_assessment_v1"),
    entity_rows=[{
        "dob_ssn": "19790429_9552",
